Anomaly Fitting Using GEN AI
============================

This project focuses on implementing an anomaly detection system using Generative AI techniques, specifically Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). It is designed to identify abnormal patterns or anomalies in datasets by training models to fit the normal data and recognize deviations from it.

Overview
--------

Anomalies can be rare or unexpected events that differ from the norm, and detecting them is critical in many fields such as fraud detection, industrial monitoring, and healthcare diagnostics. The system leverages Autoencoders to learn data reconstruction patterns and GANs to generate synthetic data, enhancing the detection of subtle anomalies.

### Key Features
- **Autoencoder for Reconstruction**: Learns patterns in normal data and identifies anomalies based on reconstruction errors.
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: Helps in creating realistic synthetic data that improves the detection process.
- **Flexible Thresholds**: Adjust detection sensitivity based on the application and dataset.
- **Wide Applicability**: Can be applied to numerous industries for tasks like early fault detection or real-time anomaly monitoring.

Technologies Used
-----------------
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow/PyTorch, NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn
- **Tools**: Git, Jupyter Notebooks, Streamlit (for UI, if applicable)

Installation
------------

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- Libraries from `requirements.txt`.

### Steps to Install
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/anomaly-fitting-gen-ai.git
    ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```
    cd anomaly-fitting-gen-ai
    ```
3. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

Usage
-----

### Running the Project
Once the project is set up, you can run the main script to start anomaly detection on your dataset:

    ```
    python main.py --dataset your_data.csv
    ```

### Training and Testing
The project involves training the Autoencoder to detect anomalies based on reconstruction errors and refining the process using GANs.

1. Prepare your dataset (ensure it contains both normal and anomalous samples).
2. Train the Autoencoder model to learn normal data patterns.
3. Use the GAN to improve and test the anomaly detection process.

### Output
The system outputs an anomaly score for each test sample, indicating how much it deviates from the normal data.
